✅ Overview:
This is a simple Student Management System developed in Java.
The program allows the user to:

Enter details of 5 students (roll number, name, and marks)
Calculate and display the average and highest marks using static methods
Display student information using method overloading

🛠 Technologies Used:
Java

Scanner class for user input
Static methods
Method Overloading
Arrays

🧾 How It Works:
User Input:

The program asks the user to enter the roll number, name, and marks for 5 students.

Example:

Enter roll number for student 1: 101
Enter name for student 1: John

Calculations:

After all students are entered:

The program calculates the average marks of all students.
Finds the highest mark among all students.
Both are printed using static methods.
Display Student Info: The program demonstrates method overloading by showing student details in 3 different ways:
By roll number: displayStudentInfo(int rollNumber)
By name: displayStudentInfo(String name)
By roll number and name: displayStudentInfo(int rollNumber, String name)

📌 Sample Output:
Average Marks: 87.2
Highest Marks: 95

Student Info (By Roll Number 101):
Name: John
Marks: 85

Student Info (By Name: Alice):
Roll Number: 102
Marks: 90

Student Info (By Roll Number 103, Name: Mark):
Marks: 78
🚀 How to Run:
Open the project in your IDE (IntelliJ, VS Code, etc.).

🏅 Bonus Feature:
The program allows the user to input data dynamically using the Scanner class 

Run the main method.
